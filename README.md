College Manager – OOP Academic Project in Java

**College Manager** is an academic Java project that demonstrates principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** through the simulation of a college management system. 
It includes functionalities for handling students, courses, instructors, and enrollments using object-oriented design patterns.

Key Concepts

- **Encapsulation** – Classes with private attributes and public methods  
- **Inheritance** – Shared behavior across different types of users (e.g., `Student`, `Instructor`)  
- **Polymorphism** – Common interfaces and overridden methods  
- **Abstraction** – Separation of interface from implementation  
- **Composition** – Classes contain references to other classes (e.g., a `Course` contains `Students`)
